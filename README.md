Larry Page and Sergey Brin originally named Google “BackRub”. I am building a search engine from scratch according to Google's original infrastructure specifications laid out in their PhD paper, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine”, by implementing a web scraper, database, PageRank algorithm, full-text lexer and search algorithm, written in modern Go / Golang.
