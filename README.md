Larry Page and Sergey Brin originally named Google “BackRub”. I am rebuilding their original infrastructure from scratch based on their PhD paper, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine”, by implementing a web scraper, database, PageRank algorithm, and title text search algorithm all in modern Go (lang).
