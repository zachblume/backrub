# backrub
Larry Page and Sergey Brin originally named Google “BackRub”. I rebuilt their original infrastructure based on their PhD paper, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine”, by implementing a web scraper, database, PageRank algorithm, and full text search algorithm all in modern Go(lang), 100% from scratch. I also blogged the entire learning process!
